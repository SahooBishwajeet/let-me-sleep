## Continuation...

As I've already mentioned in [my previous dump](https://letmesleep.sahoobishwajeet.xyz/dump/leetcode-scrapper), I had a habit of posting solutions to LeetCode problems that I solve on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SahooBishwajeet/leetcode).

In that dump I solved the 1st part of the problem, which was to scrap the question data from the LeetCode website.
Now, I need to automate the 2nd part of the problem i.e. the process of generating the solution file.
And as I maintain a README file _(as a log of all the solutions)_, I've to automate the process of updating that file as well.

## The Problem To Solve

I've a specific template for the solution files which I maintain in my repository. It is like a design standard which I've imposed on myself üòÅ.

```cpp title="<QuestionID>_<Question_Title>.cpp"
// <Question ID> : <Question Title>

/*
<Problem Statement>
*/

/*
<Example Test Cases>
*/

/*
<Constraints>
*/

/*
<My Approached Explained>
*/

class Solution {
public:
    function_name() {
        // Code goes here
    }
};
```

So, I just need to perform these things in order:

1. Extract the question data from the LeetCode website.
2. Create a file with my solution for the problem.
3. Either create a new file for the explanation of the approach or write it in the same file.
4. Generate a new CPP file with the extracted data & the solution.
5. Update the README file with the new solution.

**Pretty simple, right?**

I guess it isn't so simple as it sounds.
I've another habit of overcomplicating things üòì, the logs are supposed to be maintained in ascending order of Question ID. 
So, I can't just simply append the new entry to the end of the README file. Instead, I've to find the correct position to insert the new entry.

No worries, it's not that hard to do but I'm too sleepy üò¥.


## Let's Code It

### The Input File

I'll be using a simple text file to store data such as `URL{:bash}`, `My Approach{:bash}` & `Solution{:bash}`, which I'll be using to generate the solution file.

```txt title="input.txt"
https://leetcode.com/problems/<problem-name>/description/

/*
<Approach Explained Here>
*/

class Solution {
public:
    function_name() {
        // code here
    }
};
```

### Time For Some REGEX Magic

Now, we need to separately take them from the input file. There are many ways to do this, but I'll be using REGEX (`re{:bash}` module in Python) to extract the data.
I'll be using the patterns in detail in the script, but here's a brief overview:

```python showLineNumbers title="extract_data.py" {2-3,12}
def extract_from_input(content : str):    
    urlPattern = r'https://leetcode.com/problems/[\w-]+/description/'
    commentPattern = r'/\*([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*([^/]|[\r\n])))*\*/'

    urlMatch = re.search(urlPattern, content, re.MULTILINE)
    commentMatch = re.search(commentPattern, content, re.MULTILINE)
    
    url = urlMatch.group(0) if urlMatch else None
    comment = commentMatch.group(0) if commentMatch else None
    
    index = commentMatch.end() if commentMatch else 0
    code = content[index:].rstrip()

    return url, comment, code
```

#### The URL Pattern

```python title="urlPattern" /[\w-]+/
urlPattern = r'https://leetcode.com/problems/[\w-]+/description/'
```

`[\w-]+{:regex}` matches any number of instances of characters _(equal to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]{:regex}`)_ & _`-{:regex}`_.

#### The Comment Pattern

```python title="commentPattern" /([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*([^/]|[\r\n])))*\*/
commentPattern = r'/\*([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*([^/]|[\r\n])))*\*/'
```

1. `/\*{:regex}` matches the starting of the comment.
2. `({:regex}` opens a group.
    - `[^*]{:regex}` negates the `*{:regex}` character i.e. it consumes any `*{:regex}` which is potentially not the end of the comment in `*/{:regex}`.
    - `[\r\n]{:regex}` matches any return or newline character.
    - `|{:regex}` is the OR operator.
    - `(\*([^/]|[\r\n])){:regex}` matches any nested sequences of comments.
3. `)*{:regex}` marks the end of the group & matches any number of instances of the group.
4. `\*/{:regex}` matches the end of the comment.

### Generate The Solution File

```python showLineNumbers title="generate_solution.py" 
...
url, comment, code = extract_data(content)
questionId, title, question, difficulty, example, constraint = scrape_data(url)

fileName = f'{questionId}_{title.replace(' ', '_')}.cpp'

with open(fileName, 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'// {questionId} : {title}\n\n')
    f.write(f'/*\n{question}\n*/\n\n')
    f.write(f'/*\n{example}\n*/\n\n')
    f.write(f'/*\n{constraint}\n*/\n\n')
    f.write(comment)
    f.write(code)
```

No rocket science here, just writing the scraped data & the extracted data into a file with the required format.
Note that the file name is generated using the `questionId{:bash}` & `title{:bash}` of the question as I required.

### Update The README File

```python showLineNumbers title="update_readme.py" {11-12, 14}
readme_path = '../README.md'
if not os.path.exists(readme_path):
    with open(readme_path, 'w') as f:
        # Create the README file if it doesn't exist
        
with open(readme_path, 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    
table_start = lines.index("| # | Title | Solution |\n")
insert_index = table_start + 2
while insert_index < len(lines) and lines[insert_index].split("|")[1] < f"{int(questionId):04d}":
    insert_index += 1
    
new_entry = f"|{int(questionId):04d}|[{title}]({url})|[cpp](Solutions_CPP/{fileName})|\n"
lines.insert(insert_index, new_entry)

with open(readme_path, 'w') as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
```

First of all we need to extract the content of the README file & find the correct position to insert the new entry.
For that I'll simply iterate over the lines of the README file, match the `#{:c}` of the question ID from the table with the current question ID.

When I get the index for the new entry, I'll insert the new entry using `insert(self, index: SupportsIndex, object: _T, /){:bash}` method.
Finally, I'll write the updated content back to the README file.

## Automate GitHub Push?

> In my opinion this is just an overkill. Let's not be too lazy üòÖ.

But here is the script for those who want to automate the push to GitHub. We can use the `gitpython{:bash}` module to automate the push to GitHub.

> Note that you need to install the `gitpython{:bash}` module to use this script.

```python showLineNumbers title="push_to_github.py"
from git import Repo

repo = Repo('<path-to-repo>')
origin = repo.remote("origin")  
assert origin.exists()

msg = "<your-commit-message>"

repo.git.add('.')
repo.git.commit('-m', msg)
repo.git.push("--set-upstream", origin, repo.head.ref)
```

## For Some Other Night

> Hey... A little secret about me. I tend to forget things I've got to do. Using wall notes has helped me a lot but I had this idea of creating a Task Management System. To add an element of interest, I'm considering developing it with both CLI and GUI interfaces. And for an extra challenge, **WHY NOT MAKE IT IN C ???** üòÇüò±
