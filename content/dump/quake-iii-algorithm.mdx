I was just randomly scrolling through the internet when I came across this very interesting algorithm to
calculate the inverse square root of a number. The algorithm is known as the Quake III algorithm, named after
the game Quake III Arena, where it was first used.

## Fast? Ingenious?...But Why?

By this question, I mean why would we even need a fast inverse square root calculation? Where can it be used?

If I was to write a code to calculate the inverse square root of a number, I would have written this:

```c showLineNumbers title="inverse_sqrt.c" {4}
#include <math.h>

float inverse_sqrt(float x) {
    return 1.0f / sqrt(x);
}
```

But, this is slow. The `sqrt` function is slow. It is a complex function that involves a lot of calculations under the hood.

Now, coming back the question of why we need a faster algorithm.
In `Game Development`, we need to normalize the vectors while dealing with physics stuffs such as lighting, shadows, etc.
To normalize a vector, we use this formula:

$x = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$ , $y = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$ , $z = \frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$

Here we have to calculate the square root as well as perform a division operation 😱. Imagine a game, running at a said frames per second,
with each frame having numerous surfaces for which we need to calculate the normal vector. We can't simply go with the naive approach of calculating it, right?

> Now, I'll be honest with you with one thing. This algorithm gets an close approximation of the inverse square root, not the exact value. But since it is fast, we overlook the said 1% error it makes.

## Behold The Quake III

> Note: This is the original source code. I've not changed anything in it.

```c showLineNumbers title="quakeIII.c"
float Q_rsqrt(float number)
{
    long i;
    float x2, y;
    const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

    x2 = number * 0.5F;
    y  = number;
    i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
    i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck?
    y  = * ( float * ) &i;
    y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
    // y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 2nd iteration, this can be removed

    return y;
}
```

So, let's just skim over it and try to understand what is going on.

1. Declarations:
    - `long i {:c}` : A 32-bit integer
    - `float x2, y {:c}` : Two 32-bit decimal number
    - `const float threehalfs = 1.5F {:c}` : A 32-bit decimal representing `3/2`

2. Halfs & Fulls
    - `x2 - number * 0.5F {:c}` : Copy half of original number into x2
    - `y - number {:c}` : Copy original number into y

3. The Black Magic
    - This comprises of 3 stages, which we will discuss in details furter ahead.
    - It includes some cool addressing trickery, WTF number & newton iteration for approximation.

## IEEE 754

<details>
<summary><b>TL;DR (This sections explains IEEE 754. If you know about it already, feel free to skip this)</b></summary>

Before we actually start to read & understand the code, we need to know how are decimal/float-point numbers stored in memory.

No need to say that numbers are stored in bits 😅.
We are given 16/32/64-bits to work with. If we put a decimal number in the middle, then how do we store a decimal number, right?
It will work but just look at the number of bits we are wasting. In case of 32-bits, we can store numbers in range `[ 0, 2^32 ] {:bash}`
& if we account for negative numbers (adding a singed-bit in the front) then we can store numbers in range `[ -2^31, 2^31 ] {:bash}`.

So, smart people came up with a way to store decimal numbers in a more efficient way. They took the idea similar to scientific notation
i.e. $16.25 = 1 \times 1.625 \times 10^1$ & $-16.25 = -1 \times 1.625 \times 10^1$.

So, what do we need?
    - A sign bit to store the sign of the number.
    - A mantissa to store the significant digits of the number.
    - An exponent to store the power of 2 to which the mantissa is raised.

The number of bits are reserved for each of these fields:
    | Format | Total | Sign | Exponent | Mantissa |
    |--------|-------|------|----------|----------|
    | Half   | 16    | 1    | 5        | 10       |
    | Single | 32    | 1    | 8        | 23       |
    | Double | 64    | 1    | 11       | 52       |

For 32-bit number, we have exponent = 8 bits, but we have to include negative exponents as well.
So, instead of the desired range of `[ 0, 2^8 ] {:bash}`, we have `[ -2^7, 2^7 ] {:bash}`.
Hence, the standard uses a `bias exponent {:bash}` by simply adding `127` to the exponent value
i.e. to represent `2^0 {:bash}`, we store `127 {:bash}` in the exponent field.

For the remaining 23 bits, we notice an interesting thing that can only happen in binary.
The mantissa is always in the form `1.xxxxxx... {:bash}`. So, we don't actually need a bit to store the `1 {:bash}`.
Instead we just fix it in the mantissa during the calculation.

The diagram below shows the calculation of the decimal number `-27.15625 {:bash}` in IEEE 754 format.

![IEEE 754 Format](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQEd3lyKvkVl7Q/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1689253680464?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=bpHgfh9J7zpOuy8TjCild2wdnlcsQZ2SR0jt03OixqM)

There are more types of numbers such as:
    - `NaN {:bash}` : Not a Number
    - `Infinity {:bash}` : Positive & Negative Infinity
    - `Denormalized Numbers {:bash}` : Numbers which are too small to be represented in the standard format.
    - `Zero {:bash}` : Positive & Negative Zero

But we won't be encountering them in our use-case.

## A Little Bit Of Mathematics

Let's do something that will come in handy later on.
Now, let's see the representation of a number in IEEE 754 format:

number = $( 1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}} ) \times 2^{E - 127}$

Let's take the `logarithm (base 2) {:bash}` of the expression:

$\log_2(number) = \log_2((1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}}) \times 2^{E - 127})$ \
$= \log_2(1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}}) + E - 127$

We know another interesting fact that `log2(1 + x) ≈ x {:bash}` for small values of `x {:bash}`. Here is the [proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1111041/showing-y%E2%89%88x-for-small-x-if-y-logx1).

$\log_2(number) \approx \frac{M}{2^{23}} + \mu + E - 127$ , where $\mu$ is the error correction

After some rearrangement, we get:

$\log_2(number) \approx \frac{1}{2^{23}} (M + E \cdot 2^{23}) + \mu - 127$

Voilla! We can see the bit representation of the number in the above expression. And to calculate the logarithm, we just need to scale & shift the bits.
So, essentially the IEEE 754 format is somewhat equal to the logarithm of the number. NICE 😎!!!

## Black Magic Explained

### Evil Bit Hacking

We want to do some bit manipulation with our number.
But, unfortunately in C, we are nt allowed to do bit manipulation with floating point numbers.
So, we need a way to convert it into a data type that allows bit manipulation.

One could think of typecasting the number into an integer, but that won't work.
`i = (long) y {:c}` will just truncate the decimal part of the number & won't preserve the bit representation of our original number.

But what can we do instead is to trick the compiler into thinking that we have an integer, but we actually have a float.
Holy Moly! 😱 we can do this??? Yes, everything is possible in C 😁.

So, how do we do this? We change the type of the pointer pointing to this number to a pointer of an integer.
This will make the compiler think that the address we are pointing to is that of an integer.

```c showLineNumbers title="quakeIII.c" {4,6}
float Q_rsqrt(float number)
{
    ...
    i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
    i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck?
    y  = * ( float * ) &i;
    ...
    return y;
}
```

1. `&y {:c}` extracts the address of `y {:c}`
2. `( long * ) {:c}` casts the type of pointer to the address as that of a long integer
3. `* (..... {:c}` dereferences the address i.e. reads the bits in that address

In the second part, we convert it back to floating points for further calculation.

### What The Fuck?

Bit manipulations are cool. We can multiple, divide & even change exponents by shifting the bits.

```c showLineNumbers title="quakeIII.c" {4}
float Q_rsqrt(float number)
{
    ...
    i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck?
    ...
    return y;
}
```

For a number $x^{1}$:
    1. Doubling the exponent $x^{2}$ : Squares the number
    2. Halving the exponent $x^{1/2}$ : Gives the square root of the number
    3. Negating the above $x^{-1/2}$ : Give the inverse square root of the number

Now, recall that a IEEE 754 format is more or less approximately equal to the logarithm of the number.
So, instead of calculating $x^{-1/2}$, we will find $\log_2(x^{-1/2})$

Let $\Delta$ be the inverse square root of $x$

$\implies \log_2(\Delta) = \log_2(x^{-1/2})$ \
$\implies \log_2(\Delta) = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \log(x)$

Replacing with bit representation,

$\implies \frac{1}{2^{23}} (M(\Delta) + E(\Delta) \cdot 2^{23}) + \mu - 127 = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{1}{2^{23}} (M(x) + E(x) \cdot 2^{23}) + \mu - 127)$

After some calculations,

$\implies M(\Delta) + E(\Delta) \cdot 2^{23} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2^{23} \cdot (127 - \mu) - \frac{1}{2} \cdot (M(x) + E(x) \cdot 2^{23})$ \
$\implies M(\Delta) + E(\Delta) \cdot 2^{23} = \text{0x5f3759df} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot (M(x) + E(x) \cdot 2^{23})$

Instead of dividing by 2, we can bit shift it to the right by 1.

$\implies \Delta = \text{0x5f3759df} - (x \gg 1)$

### Newton Iteration

Newton Iteration is a method to approximate the roots of a function, by taking an approximation & returning a better approximation.
It does so by taking the tangent to the curve at the current approximation & finding the point where the tanget meets the x-axis.

So, we have the equation:

$x' = x - f(x) / f'(x)$

For our case, we have the function $f(y) = \frac{1}{y^2} - x$, since for $y = 0, f(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$.

The derivative of the function is $f'(y) = -\frac{2}{y^3}$.

$y' = y - \frac{1/y^2 - x}{-2/y^3}$ \
$\implies y' = y \frac{3 - xy^2}{2}$

So, $y' = y \cdot (3/2 - (x/2 \cdot y \cdot y))$  i.e. `y * (threehalfs - (x2 * y * y)) {:bash}`

```c showLineNumbers title="quakeIII.c" {4-5}
float Q_rsqrt(float number)
{
    ...
    y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
    // y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 2nd iteration, this can be removed

    return y;
}
```

## Some Modern Developments

In modern C++, the usual method for implementing this function's casts is through C++20's `std::bit_cast {:cpp}`. This also allows the function to work in `constexpr {:cpp}` context:

```cpp showLineNumbers title="quakeIII.cpp"
# include <bit>
# include <limits>
# include <cstdint>

constexpr float Q_rsqrt(float number) noexcept
{
  static_assert(std::numeric_limits<float>::is_iec559); // (enable only on IEEE 754)

  float const y = std::bit_cast<float>(
    0x5f3759df - (std::bit_cast<std::uint32_t>(number) >> 1));
  return y * (1.5f - (number * 0.5f * y * y));
}
```

New constants were found which reducced the relative error in the approximation by factor of 2.7.

```c title="new_constants.c"
i = 0x5F1FFFF9 - ( i >> 1 );
y = y * 0.703952253f * ( 2.38924456f - x * y * y );

return y;
```

> And this was the last piece of the puzzle. Huff!!! What an amazing algorithm this is😅.

## For Some Other Night

> I'm still stuck in the design of Task Management Application in C. It would take a while to think about it & come up with a good approach to proceed with. Meanwhile, I'll dump topics/things like this, which I find intriguing & worth sharing. Maybe some RANDOMIZATION next time 💁.
